## About writing articles and why is this important?

I have some experience with writing and editing articles so this shouldn't necessarily come as a surprise. However, it's the first time I'm trying out Medium and for it's worth what I published is part of a publication for [Udacity PyTorch Challenge](https://medium.com/udacity-pytorch-challengers). I will write a blog post about my experience in Udacity's PyTorch Challenge Scholarship course once I finish.

## About pre-trained models
Over the past two months my efforts have been directed towards gaining a good understanding of Deep Learning and by this I mean both theory and practice. During Christmas the opportunity arise to write an article a related topic. It wasn't easy to pick, I was curious to read and explain multiple topics, especially for the ones just starting their journey. 

The result was an article that motivates [why should one use pre-trained models](https://medium.com/udacity-pytorch-challengers/why-use-a-pre-trained-model-rather-than-creating-your-own-d0e3a17e202f). I'm happy with what I've got so if you're interested please have a go at it and let me know what you think.  

## Tackling a more challenging topic

**To give you some context**: The PyTorch Challenge Scholarship requires the completion of a lab challenge, basically a project where you develop and train a classifier. 

Not long after the article got submitted to the editors, together with another student we quickly decided that we could help a lot more people to improve their lab challenge if we wrote something consistent. It would also have an impact on future students, so this was a win-win situation. We've exchanged many ideas before on the same topic so this was something worth a shot.

Fine-tuning a model is quite a broad topic as it involves pretty everything hyperparameter, strategies to improve it, transfer learning, so on and so forth. With that being said I'm inviting you whether you are a beginner or experienced to have a look at my [shared article](https://medium.com/udacity-pytorch-challengers/ideas-on-how-to-fine-tune-a-pre-trained-model-in-pytorch-184c47185a20). 


Best,
Florin
