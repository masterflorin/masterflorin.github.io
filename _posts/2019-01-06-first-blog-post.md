## My very first blog post

Recently I thought about creating a dev landing page in order to better present myself and my interests. Shortly after I built it, I thought 'How about if I go further and open a blog section? It wouldn't that bad.

So that's it for my first blog post, this is where I'm going to share some of my thoughts while exercising some blogging and perhaps learning a little bit of web development along the way.

All the best,
Florin
