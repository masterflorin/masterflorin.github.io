### The beginning is always the hardest

Recently I thought about creating a dev landing page in order to better present myself and my interests. Shortly after, I thought 'How about I go ahead and open a blog section? It should't that bad' and so I did.

So that's it for my first blog post, this is where I'm going to share some of my thoughts while exercising blogging and perhaps learn  a little bit of web development along the way.

All the best,

Florin
