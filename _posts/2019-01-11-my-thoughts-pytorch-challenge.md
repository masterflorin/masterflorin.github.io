*Note: This is my personal opinion, nothing more.*

### Background

Before I start my rant, I will give you some context as to why I signed up for it. A bit more than two months I was again hitting the wall of what do I next, what do I specialize in. Note: If you didn't know, I'm working as a Data Analyst in the IT industry. In the month of October I found about an interesting opportunity to learn Deep Learning and a library called [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/). I can't remember exactly whether this was via email or Udacity's Facebook page. Maybe both :) 

I applied for the [scholarship](https://www.udacity.com/facebook-pytorch-scholarship) and got a place, me and other students, taking the total to 10,000 students on one big Slack channel as our main discussion portal. 

### General overview of the course

Fast forward a few weeks the course started. I had 2 months starting from 9 November 2018 until 9 January 2019 to complete all the course material and one final challenge in order to qualify for the 2nd phase. Second phase? Yes, the catch is if you did well enough you could be selected as one of 300 students to take the [Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://eu.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101) for free. That's 4 month's worth of high quality online education, projects and mentorship. The PyTorch Challenge was just the shorter version that served as an [intro](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-pytorch--ud188) to the subject. 

I'm not sure how familiar you are with Udacity courses, the way this worked is that we had 24/7 access to the course material, Slack workspace for announcements, discussions of all sorts for as long as the course lasted. Moreover, we also had an [official website](https://sites.google.com/udacity.com/pytorch-scholarship-facebook/home?authuser=0) with information from the Udacity team as well as other resources. Technically, you can still access the course material even after but you can't resubmit your lab challenge. 

The course itself had 9 lessons and one final lab challenge and they were all taught by experienced professionals that I will mention below. 
1. Welcome to the Scholarship Challenge (course instructors)
2. Introduction to Neural Networks (Luis Serrano)
3. Talking PyTorch with Soumith Chintala (Cezanne Camacho and Soumith Chintala)
4. Introduction to PyTorch (Mat Leonard)
5. Convolutional Neural Networks (Cezanne Camacho, Alexis Cook)
6. Style Transfer (Cezanne Camacho)
7. Recurrent Neural Networks (Luis Serrano)
8. Sentiment Prediction with RNNs (Cezanne Camacho)
9. Deploying PyTorch Models (Mat Leonard)
10. Challenge Project (course instructors)

From a learner's perspective, these were high quality lessons with well-explained concepts through videos and exercises which included jupyter notebooks and quizzes. They were also supplemented by resources provided in the instructor's note. I particularly enjoyed most of the course as this was my first Deep Learning experience, but more importantly it was an excellent main source for building foundations. 

Now the quality wasn't the same throughout the lessons as some were very well prepared while others felt a bit rushed and didn't provide a lot of room for practice either. Moreover, lessons 7 and 8 covered a very broad topic but it felt as if it wasn't as thorough as lesson 2 and 5, while lesson 9 was quite short as the lectures focused on how to cover the PyTorch's official tutorial on deploying your model with TorchScript. 

I particularly enjoyed lessons 2 to 6, with my favourite being lesson 5 (Convolutional Neural Networks). 

### The Good, The Bad, The Beautiful

**The Good:** Great introduction for beginners with low prerequisites (Python, Numpy, Pandas, some calculus, and linear algebra). It wasn't necessary to know concepts on machine learning but it would have been useful in helping you go through the material a bit faster. For a newbie (such as I), I couldn't have asked for something better. There were many opportunities for you to learn from student buddies, student mentors to study groups, and side-projects. 

**The Bad:** Not directed towards content material but to the fact that you needed a pretty fast computer, by that I mean a good GPU (preferably NVIDIA as PyTorch needs CUDA) to run models in a reasonable amount of time. For those unlucky who are still using some old laptops or computers then you have a few alternatives, the ones that don't cost money are [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/gpu.ipynb#scrollTo=3IEVK-KFxi5Z) and [Kaggle](http://kaggle.com/). For a more in-depth analysis of what option you have check out this [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/maximize-your-gpu-dollars-a9133f4e546a). 

**The Beautiful:** The community and the Udacity team. To be honest after taking finishing this challenge I can't imagine ever taking a MOOC again without a community backing me up. The Slack community was superbly handled by the Udacity team which was an accomplishment taking into account so many students. While the early days were tough due to so much noise and random activity, the community managed to become more focused and eventually organized itself into study groups and all sorts of interesting channels. In addition, there were student volunteers, alumni from the [Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://eu.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101), as well as professionals who regularly hosted AMA sessions, live-webinars on topics such as projects, networking, career advice and so much more. 

### How did I succeed?

Having a full-time job was an obstacle in this case but doable, the *key* to success here was staying organized. 
My recipe for success consisted of:
1. Schedule my time according to which units and lessons I'm taking
2. Studying everyday for at least 3-4h, plus additional hours on the weekend
3. Participate on Slack everyday whenever you're taking a 10-15 minutes break
4. Look up answers on Slack before asking, if it wasn't clear ask a question or make sum up of your discovery and post it on a channel
5. Write a weekly summary of what you've learned and accomplished during the week
6. Finish earlier than the deadline (this gives you more time to work on your project and participate in the community)

While this isn't a fail-proof receipe it certaintly there are two essential aspects about it which I would like to point out: *consistency* and *perseverance*. You need to spend a consistent amount of time on the material to get a good understanding and perseverance is what helps you surpass obstacles. The latter is also where the community can jump in as long as you are open and willing to ask for help. There is no shame in doing so, on the contrary at some point you will be able to do the same, help others who are in need. 


### Short list of accomplishments

In such a short timespan I managed to accomplish (not in order):
- Published two articles on medium
- Started building a valuable network of ambitious learners
- Participated in my first kaggle as part of a team (on-going)
- Learned the fundamentals of neural networks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, style transfer, transfer learning
- Started a website during Christmas
- Started blogging shortly after Christmas

### Last words before going

All in all, I must once again say what a valuable learning experience this course has been for me I can only encourage you to explore what Udacity has to offer in terms of free courses or nanodegrees or even applying for a [scholarship](https://www.udacity.com/scholarships).

*This was one heck of a ride. Thank you to all of you.*
